**Themes and Educational Value:** Selecting crafts that align with your child's interests—be it dinosaurs, space exploration, or historical themes—can significantly enhance their engagement and enthusiasm. Furthermore, crafts that incorporate educational components, such as learning about colours, shapes, or cultural art forms, offer an added layer of enrichment.
