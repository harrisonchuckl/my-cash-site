## Buying Guide

When purchasing a multivitamin, several factors should be considered to ensure you choose the right product for your needs:

While most multivitamins are safe for daily consumption, it's crucial to adhere to recommended dosages and consult with a healthcare professional, particularly if you have underlying health conditions.

**2. Can multivitamins replace a balanced diet?**  
Multivitamins are supplements and not replacements for a varied diet. They should complement your diet by filling nutritional gaps rather than substituting for whole foods.

This can vary from person to person. Generally, it may take a few weeks to notice significant changes. Consistency is key for optimal results.

**4. Are there any side effects associated with taking multivitamins?**  
While many people tolerate multivitamins well, some individuals may experience side effects such as nausea or diarrhoea. It's advisable to consult with a healthcare provider if you experience any adverse effects.

In conclusion, investing in a high-quality multivitamin can be a critical step towards achieving and maintaining overall well-being.
